# Predict House Sale Prices in Ames, Iowa

Distill and select important features which affected the sales price through stepwise selection and feature importance in Boosting Algorithms. 

Compare how different linear and non-linear models perform in cross-validated train scores, test scores, RMSEs on a train set and a test set.  

Most importantly, the pros and cons of using those models would be something we want to explore, identify and pay attention to.
